Chinese literature dating from as early as 650 BC tells the legend of Lo Shu 
or "scroll of the river Lo". In ancient China there was a huge flood. The great 
king Yu tried to channel the water out to sea where then emerged from the water 
a turtle with a curious figure/pattern on its shell; circular dots of numbers 
which were arranged in a three by three grid pattern such that the sum of the 
numbers in each row, column and diagonal was the same: 15, which is also the 
number of days in each of the 24 cycles of the Chinese solar year.

This pattern, in a certain way, was used by the people in controlling the river.

An experimental linear algebra library for computer vision.
Includes python bindings and a set of scripts for processing and viewing PCA 
calculations.

The code contains a few dependancies on OpenCV, but only in the image processing
domain. I'm wary of OpenCV after problems with the code on different 
architectures.

It's not currenly optimised, but simd code is planned for the matrix 
calculations.
