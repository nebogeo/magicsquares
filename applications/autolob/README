A drawing scanning program for reading webcamera images and 
converting them into seperated, background removed png images.

There are lots of controls for thresholding and crop areas, for
now read the source (in App.cpp) to find out what they do.

The images have the original centroid positions encoded in the 
filename. This allows them to be reassembled and animated using
dynamically created skeletons.

At the moment skeletons are calculated and procedurally animated
using Prims MST algorithm in the Germination X game 
(see lirec/scenarios/GerminationX/)
